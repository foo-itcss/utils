# ITCSS objects layer
Reusable utils layer for my (and your) itcss stack

### Install as a Git Submodule

```
$ git submodule add git@github.com:foo-itcss/utils.git
```
Once installed, @import into your project in its utils layer:
```
@import "utils/utils";
````
Alternatively you can import only needed files, e.g.:
```
@import "utils/layout.grids";
```

#### Pull requests are welcome
But avoid to "break" the behaviour of current rules, since they're shared with others projects.

To [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/) for the great idea of ITCSS
